## 📋 Project Overview

This project addresses urban traffic congestion through an innovative combination of machine learning and pathfinding algorithms. By accurately predicting traffic flow and optimizing route selection, we aim to reduce travel times and improve urban mobility.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

- Predict traffic congestion levels using vehicle count data
- Optimize route selection using traffic-aware pathfinding
- Reduce average travel time in urban environments

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Analysis

Our model processes various traffic-related features:

- 🕒 Time of day
- 📅 Day of week
- 🚗 Vehicle counts:
  - Cars
  - Bikes
  - Buses
  - Trucks

### Traffic Classification

Traffic situations are categorized into four levels:

- 🟢 Low: Minimal traffic
- 🟡 Normal: Standard flow
- 🟠 High: Elevated congestion
- 🔴 Heavy: Severe congestion

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Models

#### 1. Naive Bayes Classifier (Initial Approach)

- Simple probabilistic classifier
- Performance: ~60% accuracy
- Limited by feature independence assumption

#### 2. Random Forest Classifier (Final Solution)

- Ensemble learning method
- Performance: 99.9% accuracy
- Captures complex feature interactions

```python
# Model prediction formula
y = f(Day, Car_Count, Bike_Count, Bus_Count, Truck_Count)
```

### Route Optimization

Implemented A* algorithm with traffic-aware heuristics:

```math
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
```

where:

- `f(n)`: Total estimated path cost
- `g(n)`: Cost from start to node n
- `h(n)`: Estimated cost from n to goal

## 📊 Results

### Model Performance

| Model         | Accuracy | Key Feature     |
